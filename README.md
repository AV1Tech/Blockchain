## Overview

This repository provides an implementation of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) using Rust. Zero-Knowledge Proofs allow one party (the prover) to prove to another party (the verifier) that a statement is true without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself. This implementation is built for educational purposes and demonstrates how ZKPs can be implemented and utilized in Rust.

## Features

- **Basic Zero-Knowledge Proof Protocols**: Implementations of simple ZKP protocols.
- **Elliptic Curve Cryptography**: Utilizes elliptic curve cryptography for secure proof generation.
- **Extensible and Modular**: Designed to be easily extendable with additional proof systems.
- **Secure**: Focuses on cryptographic security and best practices.

## Installation

To use this library, ensure you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) installed. You can install it via `rustup`:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
